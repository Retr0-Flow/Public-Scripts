# qdFTP
The quick and dirty FTP script.

It's main purpose is to let you FTP to anywhere using your console. (If you console doesnt support FTP but does support python3 for some reason)

This is a very basic script that uses FTP with no security meaning all your data can be captured and reconstructed by someone sniffing your network.

Use at your own peril.
