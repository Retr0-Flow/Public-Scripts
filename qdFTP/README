The quick and dirty FTP script.
It's main purpose is to let you FTP to anywhere using your console. (If you console doesnt support FTP in line for some reason)

This is a very basic script that uses FTP over SFTP meaning all your data can be captured and reconstructed by someone sniffing your network.

Use at your owm peril.
